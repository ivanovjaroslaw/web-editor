## Webpack
- should we use `devServer.watchOptions.poll = true` - looks like it's required for NFS or VM when common watching is not working. maybe it can extend performance
- should we use explicit `lint` task along with `eslint-loader` pre-loader?
- `devServer.contentBase` looks incorrectly
- about production with vue - https://vue-loader-v14.vuejs.org/ru/workflow/production.html

## Other
- eslint and WS config should be synchronized
- try to use correct HTML5 tags
